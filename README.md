## Description
This webpage is to provide a service that provides search engine optimization, online reputation management. and social media marketing.  
During this project, I refactored the HTML and CSS code in order to make it better for search engine optimisation by providing semantic elements for the HTML code. I also consolidated the CSS styling to make it more efficient by grouping 'like styled' elements into single classes.
